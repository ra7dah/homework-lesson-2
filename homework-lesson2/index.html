            <h4>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The 2002 PlayStation 2 title <i>TimeSplitters 2</i> outsold Concord in the UK in August 2024.</li>
                <li>Concord ranked <b>261st</b> on the best-selling games list for August, with <i>TimeSplitters 2</i> coming in <b>218th</b> place.</li>
                <li>TimeSplitters: Future Perfect, the 2005 sequel, also beat Concord, coming in <b>229th</b> place.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <p>
                <b>Concord</b> was outsold by the retro PlayStation 2 title <i>TimeSplitters</i> 2 in the UK during its launch month, 
                according to recent digital sales data collected in the region. <br>
                This is yet another indicator of the game's poor sales performance before its shutdown on September 6, 
                with some estimates stating that only 25,000 copies of <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/concord/"><i><u>Concord</u></i></a> had been sold globally.
                <br><br>
                Released on August 23, 2024 for PS5 and PC, <i>Concord</i> was a 5v5 hero shooter from the Washington-based PlayStation subsidiary Firewalk Studios. <br>
                Although the <i>Concord</i> beta did receive some positive reception from players just a month prior, the title's incredibly low player count at launch spelled trouble for its future. <br>
                Just a week and a half later, on September 3, Firewalk Studios announced that <a href="https://gamerant.com/concord-shuts-down/"><i><u>Concord was shutting down on September 6</u></i></a>, which shocked many PlayStation fans. <br>
                All digital sales were immediately pulled from the PlayStation Store, Steam marketplace, and Epic Games Store, and refunds for both digital and physical copies were issued to all players.

                In August, the <a href="https://gamerant.com/timesplitters-ps-plus-premium-trophy-support/"><u>beloved 2002 PS2 game TimeSplitters 2</u></a> and its 2005 sequel <i>TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</i> ranked higher in digital sales compared to <i>Concord</i> in the UK, according to new GSD digital data reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/75-of-games-sold-in-august-were-downloaded-uk-monthly-charts"><u>Gamesindustry.biz</u></a>. 
                Digital <i>Concord</i> sales ranked 261st in the best-selling games list for August in the UK, while TimeSplitters 2 ranked 218th and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect ranked 229th. <br>
                It's worth noting that <i>Concord</i> was tracked from launch on August 23 to August 31 on PS5 and PC, while the TimeSplitters titles were tracked from their PlayStation Store release on August 20 to the end of the month. <br>
                What's more, the TimeSplitters games are much cheaper at just $9.99 each, compared to <i>Concord's</i> more costly $39.99.

            <h2>TimeSplitters 2 Outsold Concord in August 2024</h2>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TimeSplitters 2 ranked 218th in digital sales, followed by TimeSplitters: Future Perfect in 229th place.</li>
                        <li>Both TimeSplitters games outsold Concord, which came in 261st place.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Since <a href="https://gamerant.com/concord-shutting-down-when-refunds/"> <i><u>Concord digital sales ceased completely on September 3</u></i></a>, the game's overall digital sales for the month of September 2024 are expected to be incredibly meager in the UK. <br>
                    With well over 200 titles tracking higher than <i>Concord</i>, it's clear that gamers in the region prioritized many other titles in the month of August. <br>
                    The <i>TimeSplitters</i> games may perform admirably in September as well, as trophy support was recently added for the classic titles. <br><br>
                    
                    UK physical sales data for <i>Concord</i> was not disclosed for the month, but it likely exhibited similar sales performance to the digital version. <br>
                    <i>Concord</i> is still unplayable with a physical copy, and it's unclear when or if the game will return at a later date as a free-to-play title. <br>
                    Currently, PlayStation and Firewalk Studios are exploring options for <i>Concord</i>, and an upcoming episode of Amazon's Secret Level anthology series will focus on <i>Concord's</i> universe.
